Pulled a bunch of deployment files for different applications, and was totally thrilled to have done it with [@Šarūnas](https://github.com/CrocAx) .

The goal is to provide a simple way to deploy different applications, each with their own proper explanation of the process. You can use these files as a reference to deploy your own applications, or use them as a starting point for your own deployment files.
