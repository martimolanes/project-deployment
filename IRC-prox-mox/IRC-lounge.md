## Introduction

IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is an older instant messaging service comprising clients, servers, a communication protocol, and server platform.

## Research and Familiarization
   - Understand the components of IRC, including clients, servers, communication protocols, and server platforms.
   - Explore the functionality and features of IRC to gain insights into its operation.

## IRC Server Deployment
   - Deploy an IRC server to facilitate communication between clients.
   - Choose a suitable server platform or cloud service for hosting the IRC server.
   - Ensure that the IRC server is accessible within the xamklab network.

## Client Setup
   - Set up two IRC clients for testing and communication.
   - One client must be Irssi, designed for the Linux command line (a Windows version also exists).
   - Choose another IRC client software (options available in the Wikipedia article) for the second client.

## Testing and Communication
   - Verify the successful connection between the deployed IRC server and the clients.
   - Ensure both Irssi and the chosen additional client can communicate effectively.

## Accessibility
   - Aim for a full points solution by making the IRC server accessible from the xamklab network.
   - Optionally, explore the possibility of making the server accessible from the internet using a cloud service or a separate server.

## Conclusion

Summarize the key achievements, challenges, and outcomes of the IRC server deployment project. Highlight the importance of having a reliable instant messaging platform for company-wide communication.
