## Introduction
This report presents the design and deployment of a private network, both virtually and physically, for a simulated corporate environment. Using VirtualBox, pfSense, Ubuntu, and Cisco hardware, we established a network comprising two PCs, a SAMBA server, and a client.

## Virtual Deployment
